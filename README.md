# Compute Shader Experiments
Some basic experiments with compute shaders, I've just want to learn them.

I usually don't share much stuff pubicly, but this repo is for my students.

All exepriments have their scene in /Scene folder

## Slime Simulation
Slime simulation is a simple concept where many agents are guided by their frontal sensors.
Each sensor evaluates the concentration of some pheromone in their specific area.
The agent will turn forward the sensor that picks up more pheromone.

To start the simulation, hit play in the editor and Run / Pause button in "SlimeSimulation" component in "SlimeSimulation" game object (pretty straight, right?)

### References
There is a lot of stuff on the internet that can be useful. Sometimes you have to worry about quality more than quantity.
Sebastian League's ["Coding Adventure: Ant and Slime Simulations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A) is a perfect way to start exploring this world.

## To do
